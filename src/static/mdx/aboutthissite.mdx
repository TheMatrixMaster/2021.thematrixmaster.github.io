As a software developer, Iâ€™ve always wanted to build a personal website that would authentically portray my personality and journey. So, since I had some time during Christmas break, I got to work!

First, I needed a design. I enjoy a minimalistic look with soft colors and sans-serif font, so I went online and found inspiration in [thalida.me](https://thalida.me/), an awesome personal site made by Thalida Noel. Next, I went into Figma and produced my [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1058251760163445535/Personal-Site-%26-Portfolio), which are now open source!

For the dev phase, I had solid experience with ReactJS, but I always wanted to try out Gatsby which was perfect for this simple static site. Plus, Gatsby offered a window into using GraphQL which was also on my bucket list!

Here are some useful resources that helped me along the way:

- [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) for design inspiration
